# VoxelPaint

This is a voxel painter for Vircadia/Overte it is a copy of the file original created by High Fidelity.
There was no licence on the Scripts so I assume they are Apache 2.0 like all other examples on their github.

How to use:

1 Create a cube and add voxel-paint-init.js as a client script (use the raw button to create a link that can be linked in Vircadia/Overte).
2 Import the JSON file with the brushes.
3 Click the cube. A Floor and a Pallet should spawn
4 Grab the pallet with your left hand and trigger it with your right hand.
5 This should rez and attach a pallet with paint swatches in one hand and a brush in the other.
6 You can paint voxels directly above the floor area
7 You can select different colors to dip the end of the brush on the pallet
8 You can chose different size brushes by moving your hand on the brush/cloths
9 Face you palm of your hand doen and use the grip button to remove the pallet and brush.
10 Happy Painting!
